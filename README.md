> [!IMPORTANT]
> Hi, I'm **Jeffrey** (carpetxie)!
>
> I'm an undergrad at **Dartmouth College** (Math + CS + Philosophy) interested in the space between **machine learning**, **human-centered AI**, and **applied systems**.
> 
> I spent this past summer automating underwriting at Adaptional (YC S25). I've since returned to school and write conduct research / write blogs for Adaptional. 
>
>I enjoy working on problems where the bottleneck lean closer to creative ideation than execution. This is a mix of research and engineering: training and steering models, building data/ML pipelines, and shipping full-stack features that people actually use.
>
> This page is a quick snapshot of what I do and what I enjoy building. I keep more details and links on [jxie.me](https://jxie.me).

> [!NOTE]
> **Current areas of focus:**
>
> *This is for the Dartmouth Winter 26 Term.*
> - **LLM steering and representation learning** – Full sprinting on representation fine-tuning and intervention subspaces for controlling traits in LLMs. 
> - **Hackathons** – Will try to attend(and win) >= 2 hackathons in W26.
> - **Skiing** - I WILL learn how to ski.
