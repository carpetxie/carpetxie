> [!IMPORTANT]
> Hey, I'm **Jeffrey** (carpetxie)!
>
> I'm an undergrad at **Dartmouth College** (Math + CS) interested in the space between **machine learning**, **human-centered AI**, and **applied systems**.  
> I like working on problems that mix research and engineering: training and steering models, building data/ML pipelines, and shipping full-stack features that people actually use.
>
> This page is a quick snapshot of what I do and what I enjoy building — I keep more details and links on [jxie.me](https://jxie.me).

> [!NOTE]
> **Current focus areas:**
>
> - **LLM steering and representation learning** – working on representation fine-tuning and intervention subspaces for controlling traits in large language models.  
> - **Applied ML in products** – building and shipping ML-powered features and backend services for real use cases (e.g., insurance underwriting, financial data systems).  
> - **Signals, time series, and human behavior** – using ML and signal processing for domains like weather forecasting and crisis hotline dynamics.

> [!TIP]
> A few representative things I’ve worked on — you can find more in my pinned repositories or on my site.

- **Crumbling Quote Signal Simulation**  
  `Python · NumPy · pandas · SimPy · SciPy · Matplotlib · Jupyter`  
  Simulations and analysis around “crumbling quote” dynamics and stress in IEX CQS, including large-scale agent-based and Hawkes process modeling.  
  → Link: [IEX-CQI](https://github.com/carpetxie/IEX-CQI)

- **CrisisHoldML**  
  `PyTorch · pandas · Jupyter · Librosa · Survey data`  
  ML models to study caller retention and escape motivation during suicide hotline wait times, in collaboration with partners across institutions.

- **Neural Synchrony for Weather Forecasting**  
  `PyTorch · NumPy · Signal processing`  
  Experiments with complex-valued synchrony in artificial neurons for forecasting tasks, improving performance over real-valued baselines on weather data.
